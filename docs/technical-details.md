# Izelize Technical Documentation

## **Overview**
Izelize is a platform designed for **knowledge synthesis, collaboration, and innovation**. This document outlines the technical architecture, APIs, database schema, and integration details necessary for development and maintenance.

---

## **1. System Architecture**
Izelize follows a **modular microservices architecture** to ensure scalability, flexibility, and high availability.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit (for a dynamic and lightweight UI experience)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (handling API requests and logic)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (structured data storage with optimized queries for knowledge synthesis)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (JWT-based authentication)
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage (for documents, images, and user uploads)
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: WebSockets (via Supabase Realtime)
- **AI Services**: OpenAI API (for summarization, synthesis, and smart recommendations)
- **Hosting & Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) and Supabase (backend and database)

---

## **2. API Documentation**
Izelize provides a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend, along with WebSocket support for real-time updates.

### **Base URL**
```
https://api.izelize.org/v1
```

### **Authentication**
All API requests require authentication using JWT tokens. Users must include an `Authorization` header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

### **Endpoints**
#### **User Management**
| Method | Endpoint       | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| POST   | /auth/signup  | Register a new user |
| POST   | /auth/login   | Authenticate and retrieve a token |
| GET    | /users/me     | Get current user profile |
| PUT    | /users/:id    | Update user profile |

#### **Knowledge Synthesis**
| Method | Endpoint               | Description |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| GET    | /synthesis/:id          | Retrieve a synthesis entry |
| POST   | /synthesis              | Create a new synthesis entry |
| PUT    | /synthesis/:id          | Update an existing synthesis entry |
| DELETE | /synthesis/:id          | Delete a synthesis entry |

#### **Collaboration**
| Method | Endpoint               | Description |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| GET    | /projects               | Get all projects |
| POST   | /projects               | Create a new collaborative project |
| GET    | /projects/:id           | Get details of a specific project |
| PUT    | /projects/:id           | Update a project |
| DELETE | /projects/:id           | Delete a project |

#### **AI-Powered Insights**
| Method | Endpoint               | Description |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| POST   | /ai/summarize           | Summarize a document or text input |
| POST   | /ai/generate-ideas      | Generate synthesized ideas from multiple sources |
| POST   | /ai/concept-map         | Generate a knowledge graph from user inputs |

## **3. Database Schema**
The PostgreSQL database consists of the following core tables:

### **Users Table**
```
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    display_name TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

### **Synthesis Entries Table**
```
CREATE TABLE synthesis (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    tags TEXT[],
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

### **Projects Table**
```
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    owner_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    members UUID[],
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

---

## **4. Authentication & Security**
- **User authentication** is handled via JWT tokens issued by Supabase Auth.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** is implemented to manage user permissions.
- **Data encryption** is applied to sensitive fields (e.g., password hashes, private documents).
- **Rate limiting** is in place to prevent API abuse.

---

## **5. Real-Time Features**
- **Collaboration**: Users can edit synthesis entries and see real-time updates using WebSockets.
- **Project Notifications**: Team members receive notifications for project updates.
- **Live AI Suggestions**: AI-generated insights update in real-time based on user input.

---

## **6. Integrations**
Izelize supports integrations with external platforms:
- **Google Drive & Notion**: Import and synthesize content from external sources.
- **Slack & Discord**: Notifications and team updates.
- **Zapier API**: Custom automation workflows.
- **GitHub & GitLab**: Sync documentation and research findings with development repositories.

---

## **7. Deployment & DevOps**
### **Hosting**
- **Frontend**: Hosted on **Vercel** for seamless deployments.
- **Backend**: Hosted on **Supabase** for managed database and authentication.

### **CI/CD Pipeline**
- GitHub Actions automates testing and deployments.
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and consistency.

---
